## General Information
Notekeeper is built upon [A-Simple-Note-Taking-Web-App by Omkar Pathak](https://github.com/OmkarPathak/A-Simple-Note-Taking-Web-App). This project is a part of Byte Size's Final Project in the Strategio Enterprise Simulator: to create and run a CI/CD pipeline for a web application. The application's [Features](#features) are detailed later on in this document. In addition to those, this repository contains workflows to build and test Python project files, and (if enabled) deploy the web app to an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform Cloud.
